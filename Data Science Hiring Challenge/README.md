# HackerEarth - Data Science Hiring Challenge

## Predict project's success

### Problem Statement
Kickstarter is a community of more than 10 million people comprising of creative, tech enthusiasts who help in bringing creative project to life. Till now, more than $3 billion dollars have been contributed by the members in fuelling creative projects. The projects can be literally anything – a device, a game, an app, a film etc.

Kickstarter works on all or nothing basis i.e if a project doesn’t meet it goal, the project owner gets nothing. For example: if a projects’s goal is $500. Even if it gets funded till $499, the project won’t be a success.

Recently, kickstarter released its public data repository to allow researchers and enthusiasts like us to help them solve a problem. Will a project get fully funded ?
